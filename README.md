# DIY_Digital_Alarm_Clock
A DYI Digital Alarm Clock based on the Philips AJ3400.

Since my Philips AJ3400 Alarm Clock broke, I deciced to create my own Digital Alarm Clock using the remaining AJ3400 hardware. 

The software is written in JAL, running on a PIC Microcontroller.

You can find this project on Instructables: https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Digital-Alarm-Clock-With-FM-Radio/

A video of the operation can be found on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1h5q1JR-9s
